Start from the code presented in the course (first Spring MVC application).

1) Make it run and test it.

2) From the home page add the following links (and the required functionality in the back-end):

-Add User: allows us to add a new user (id, name, email)

-View Users: show all users

3) Add to Product a price and category, modify existing code to also add and show these attributes

4) Add a link "Find products" in the main page which will take you to a form in which you can search products by their category, min price AND/OR max price. Once the form is submitted, the list of products that match the criteria should be displayed.
